# Real Estate Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering for a real estate dataset. The dataset has been processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, followed by feature extraction and transformation for predictive modeling.

## Requirements
Before running the code, install the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-Estate-Analysis.git
cd Real-Estate-Analysis

2. Run Data Cleaning
python scripts/clean_data.py

3. Run Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb

4. Run Feature Engineering
jupyter notebook notebooks/feature_engineering.ipynb

5. Generate Final Processed Dataset
python scripts/run_analysis.py

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Standardizes area and price units, handles missing values, and removes duplicates.  
- EDA: Analyzes property pricing trends, categorical distributions, and correlations.  
- Feature Engineering: Creates derived features and applies TF-IDF for text analysis.  
- Outlier Handling: Uses Z-score and IQR filtering to remove extreme values.

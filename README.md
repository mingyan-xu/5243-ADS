## Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering for a real estate dataset. The dataset has been processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, followed by feature extraction and transformation for predictive modeling.

## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository
```{python} 
git clone https://github.com/mingyan-xu/RealSTAT5243 Project.git  
cd STAT5243 Project1
```

3. Run Python file  
jupyter notebook notebooks/5243_CodeFile.ipynb

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Standardizes area and price units, handles missing values, and removes duplicates.  
- EDA: Analyzes property pricing trends, categorical distributions, and correlations.  
- Feature Engineering: Creates derived features and applies TF-IDF for text analysis.  
- Outlier Handling: Uses Z-score and IQR filtering to remove extreme values.
